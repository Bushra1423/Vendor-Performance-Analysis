## ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Engineering & Cleaning  
- Built a custom **Python + SQLite pipeline** to integrate purchase, sales, and freight datasets.  
- Created summary tables using complex SQL queries with **CTEs** for vendor-level aggregation.  
- Applied robust data cleaning (handling missing values, standardizing formats, removing invalid transactions).  

### ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Identified **negative gross profit transactions** and extreme outliers in freight and purchase prices.  
- Correlation analysis showed that pricing had minimal impact on sales revenue but influenced margins.  
- Detected **$2.7M unsold capital**, highlighting inefficiencies in slow-moving inventory.  

### ðŸ”¹ Advanced Business Insights  
- Top 10 vendors contributed **65.7% of total purchases**, exposing supplier concentration risks.  
- Found **198 brands** with high margins but low sales â†’ potential candidates for promotions or pricing adjustments.  
- Bulk purchasing reduced unit costs by **72%**, reinforcing economies of scale benefits.  
- Statistical validation confirmed **significant differences in profitability models** between top- and low-performing vendors.  

### ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Dashboard (Power BI)  
- Designed a **Vendor Performance Dashboard** with KPIs:  
  - Total Sales, Purchases, Gross Profit, Profit Margin, Unsold Capital.  
- Drill-down views for:  
  - **Top Vendors, Top Brands, Low-Performing Vendors/Brands**, and contribution analysis.  
- Interactive donut, bar, and scatter visuals for comparative insights.
